## Detectron 2 to detect objective

__Face Detection on Custom Dataset with Detectron2 and PyTorch__


### What is Detectron 2 ?

* Detectron 2 is a framework for building state of the art object detection and image segmentation models. It is developed by the Facebook Research team.

* The real power of Detectron2 lies in the HUGE amount of pre-trained models available at the Model Zoo.

* It is powered by the [PyTorch] deep learning framework.

* Includes more features such as panoptic segmentation, Densepose, Cascade R-CNN, rotated bounding boxes, PointRend, DeepLab, ectc,....

* Here we benchmark the training speed of a Mask R-CNN in detectron2, with some other popular open source Mask R-CNN implementations, this based on: https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/notes/benchmarks.html

* Models can be exported to torchscript format or caffe2 format for deployment.

### Installation
